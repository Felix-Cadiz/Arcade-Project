# Arcade-project

Help Professor Snape clone himself by drinking potions seen in the Grand Hall. Unfortunately, these potions disappear and occasionally jump around (if food() is initialized in renderState()). Due to these unfortunate events, Professor can do nothing but roam around the Grand Hall, magically appear where he started, or crash into one of the four walls, ending his search with zero potions to his name.
